# Dog V. Cat Classifier
This classifier was trained on a 6-layer convolutional neural network, using tflearn. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). The accuracy was ~80% and I'm excited with the results. I used [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) as reference.
