# Machine Learning
I'm a beginner in the world of machine learning. I'll be practicing and experimenting in this repository. I've made it public for others interested in seeing my learning process.

# Contents
* [Machine Learning Tests](notebook/) - Playing with recommendation systems and image
 classification
 * [Dog V Cat Classifier](ImageClassifier/) - Classifies images of dogs and cats, I used a lot of [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex)'s tutorials
 * [Sentiment Analysis](SentimentAnalysis/) - My rough attempt at a naive bayes sentiment classifier from scratch (results are poor)
 * [Improved Sentiment Analysis](ImprovedSentimentAnalysis/) - Followed a tutorial and used libraries. Random tree classifier + word2vec to perform sentiment analysis. Trained on a 25k movie rating dataset.
 * [MNIST Beginner](MNISTBeginner/) - Logistic regression classifier by [tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)
 * [Basic Neural Network](NN/) - Writing a neural network library from scratch in python
